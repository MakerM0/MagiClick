[GitHub - MakerM0/MagiClick: A button](https://github.com/MakerM0/MagiClick)

The project uses [WCH's CH582F](https://www.wch.cn/products/CH583.html), a RISC-V chip, which supports BLE. The SDK comes with a multitasking system TMOS, which is very convenient for writing code.

The button can implement a variety of functions.
For example:

- Shutter via BLE
- Stopwatch
- Clock
- Pomodoro
- Music playback controller via BLE
- counter
- Random numbers
- 

It includes an expansion interface to support communication with I2C devices, such as temperature and humidity monitoring, light monitoring, etc.
You can achieve more depending on your needs.

The above file can be printed using a 3D printer.

The Glass cover must be transparent.

For Screen cover, black printing is recommended.

The screw hole is not used yet, please use glue to fix it.

I'll update the file that uses the screw holes when I'm free, hopefully not for too long.
